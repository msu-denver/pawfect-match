# Overview

Use this section to present the product vision, which is a clear statement of the overall goal and purpose of the product—what it aims to achieve, why it exists, and the target audience. Include a **use case diagram** that illustrates the main user interactions. This will give readers a clear and comprehensive overview of the project.

# Design

## User Stories

Describe the **user stories** for the project, which are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user. Each **user story** should include clear **acceptance criteria** and a **point estimate**. The **user stories** must align with the **use case diagram** and should be labeled as US#1, US#2, and so on. We suggest creating a separate Markdown section for each **user story**. 

Use the following template when writing your **user stories**. 

```
As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so that I can [achieve some goal].

Given that [context], when [some action is carried out] then [a set of observable outcomes should occur].
```

## Sequence Diagram

At least one **user story**, unrelated to user creation or authentication, must be detailed using a **sequence diagram**. A **sequence diagram** is a type of UML diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario, emphasizing the order of messages exchanged between components over time. This helps visualize the flow of operations and the responsibilities of different parts of the system.

## Model 

Include a **class diagram** that clearly describes the **model classes** used in the project and their associations. A **class diagram** is a UML diagram that represents the structure of the system by showing its classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them (such as inheritance, aggregation, or composition). This helps visualize how the data and logic are organized within the application.

# Development Process 

This section should describe, in general terms, how Scrum was applied in the project. Include a table summarizing the division of the project into sprints, the **user story** goals planned for each sprint, the ones actually completed, and the start and end dates of each sprint. You may also add any relevant observations or reflections about the sprints as you see fit.

|Sprint#|Goals|Start|End|Done|Observations|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|US#1, US#2, ...|mm/dd/23|mm/dd/23|US#1|...|

As in Project 2, you should take notes on the major Scrum meetings: planning, daily scrums, review, and retrospective. These meetings are essential for tracking progress, identifying obstacles, and ensuring continuous improvement. Use the Scrum folder and the shared templates to record your notes in an organized and consistent manner.

# Testing 

In this section, share the results of the tests performed to verify the quality of the developed product, including the test coverage relative to the written code. Test coverage indicates how much of your code is exercised by tests, helping assess reliability. There is no minimum coverage requirement, but ensure there is at least some coverage through one white-box test (which examines internal logic and structure) and one black-box test (which validates functionality from the user’s perspective).
